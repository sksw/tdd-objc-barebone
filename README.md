The aim of this tutorial is to **(1)** provide a barebone Objective-C TDD environment for developers to play around with, and **(2)** introduce developers to [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) style testing on iOS.

If you're brand new to TDD or doing it from a BDD perspective, then you're in the right place.  Follow the setup instructions below and work through the provided BDD exercise to learn the basics!

## Setting Up

1. `pod install`, if you don't have cocoapods, try `$ sudo gem install cocoapods` or visit the [CocoaPods getting started site](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
2. `tddObjcBlank.xcworkspace`
3. Hit `⌘`+`U` to run the tests.  You should see something like,
```
Finished in 0.0062 seconds

0 examples, 0 failures
Test Suite 'All tests' passed at 2017-04-11 17:18:49.269.
	 Executed 0 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.000 (0.036) seconds

and voila!  You're good to go!


## The BDD Exercise

> Build a calculator that computes the total cost of a list of goods.  Tax rules are as follows,
>   * _10% HST on all goods except books and food_
>   * _5% GST on books_
>   * _Food is tax exempt_

In this exercise, we've decided to split the feature into the stories **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D** below.

Begin by opening `tddObjcBlankTests/tax/ItemSpec.mm` and writing a failing test for the first story.  Then continue to `tddObjcBlank/tax/Item.m` to fill out the passing implementation.  Don't forget to check out [these tips](#helpful-tips).  Go [here](#a-few-notes-on-tooling) if you're interested in learning a bit more about the TDD framework.

**Story A**

> **Given:**  Jimmy is in a hurry to purchase some goods.  
> **When:**  Jimmy supplies his list of items to the cost calculator.  
> **Then:**  Jimmy is shown the final cost of his goods with 10% HST added.  

**Story B**

> **Given:**  Jimmy is looking to purchase some books (HST exempt, but subject to 5% GST tax).  
> **When:**  Jimmy supplies his list of books to the cost calculator.  
> **Then:**  Jimmy is shown the final cost of his books with 5% GST added.  

**Story C**

> **Given:**  Jimmy is feeling hungry, but first needs to know the wallet-damage of his food (tax exempt).  
> **When:**  Jimmy supplies his list of produce to the cost calculator.  
> **Then:**  Jimmy is shown the final cost of his food with no tax added.  

**Story D**

> **Given:**  Jimmy is mindful of his budget and wishes to know the total cost of his shopping list before buying.  
> **When:**  Jimmy supplies his shopping list to the cost calculator.  
> **Then:**  Jimmy is shown an accurate final cost of his shopping list with tax included.  
>  
> **Acceptance Criteria:**  
> - 10% HST on all goods except books and food  
> - 5% GST on books  
> - food is tax exempt  

A set of solutions to this exercise can be found under the `tax_swu` folder.  To run the tests, simply remove the `x` from `xdescribe` in each spec.

## Helpful Tips

- `⌘`+`U` to run tests.
- prefix `f` to focus the test (on a `describe`, `context`, or `it`)
- prefix `x` to exclude the test (on a `describe`, `context`, or `it`)
- use `cdes`, `cccont`, and `cit` to quickly write tests (if you don't have these snippets, install them [here](#boiler-plate-and-auto-completion))

### Boiler plate and auto-completion

You may want to run,

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pivotal/cedar.git && cd cedar
$ ./installCodeSnippetsAndTemplates # or rake install
```
and restart Xcode to get the `Cedar` template and snippets.  The template makes creating pre-formatted `spec` files easy, and the snippets make writing new tests easy.

### Creating a new spec

Hit `⌘`+`N` and choose to create a new cedar spec,

![Create new spec](readme-resources/new_cedar_spec.png)

The name of the spec will be the name of the class you'd like to test.  Make sure you're adding the file to the test target.

![Add to test target](readme-resources/test_target.png)

And you're good to go.  Read the next section about the [anatomy of a spec](#anatomy-of-a-spec) if you're unsure about what to do next.

### The anatomy of a spec

Your tests should read like an English sentence that _describes_ input, stimulus, and output.  For example, a story like,

> **Given:**  Human beings experience pain negatively.  
> **When:**  A person is kicked.  
> **Then:**  He/she cries out in pain.  

Your test might look like,

```objective-c
describe(@"Person", ^{
    __block MyPerson *subject;
    
    describe(@"kicked", ^{
        beforeEach(^{
            // This is where you setup your pre-conditions (i.e. the 'GIVEN' items)
            subject = [[MyPerson alloc] init];
            // After setting up your pre-conditions, you'll also want to 'kick-off' your test (i.e. the 'WHEN' items).
            [subject kick];
        });
        it(@"should cry out in pain", ^{
            // This is where you assert your outcome (i.e. the 'THEN')
            subject.isCryingOutInPain should be_truthy;
        });
    });
});
```

And when you run your test, you'll see the following in the console,

```
Test Case '-[MyPerson kicked_should_cry_out_in_pain]' started.
Test Case '-[MyPerson kicked_should_cry_out_in_pain]' passed (0.001 seconds).
```

Functionally, `describe` and `context` work exactly the same, but `context` is typically used to contrast parallel paths in the code.  For example,

```objective-c
describe(@"Person", ^{
    __block MyPerson *subject;
    
    describe(@"kicked", ^{
        beforeEach(^{
            subject = [[MyPerson alloc] init];
        });
        context(@"hard", ^{
            beforeEach(^{
                [subject kickHard];
            });
            it(@"should cry out in pain", ^{
            });
        });
        context(@"softly", ^{
            beforeEach(^{
                [subject kickSoftly];
            });
            it(@"should giggle", ^{
            });
        });
    });
});
```

As you probably noticed, you can include a `beforeEach` at each level of testing.  Setup and teardown happens for every single test so (1) no test contamination occurs, and (2) you can count on every `beforeEach` to happen in sequence leading up to your `it`.

You may have also noticed that the nesting makes things look quite confusing.  My suggestion is to avoid more than 2 or 3 levels of nesting, and move the `subjectAction` into the asset where appropriate.  Remember, the focus is on _**readability, maintainability, and living documentation**_, **not** on _**dogmatic structuring**_.

## A Few Notes on Tooling

In this example, the test framework we are using is [Cedar](https://github.com/pivotal/cedar).  It builds on top of `XCTest` to provide a BDD-styled way of writing tests in iOS.  It comes with a helpful set of matchers (for asserting and comparing outcomes) built in, and provides the ability to create custom matchers.

Another very popular test framework is [Kiwi](https://github.com/kiwi-bdd/Kiwi).  It compliments nicely with additional matches from [Expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta).
